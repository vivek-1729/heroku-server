### TODO List

- [x] Should be able to see players even when not our turn but not be able to submit 
- [x] More than 25
- [x] Assign each player to allegiance
- [ ] Snake draft
- [ ] Set draft order by name (in waiting room for admin) 
- [ ] Only show players whose allegiance is unpicked (when rendering main page)
- [ ] Add teams to bottom
- [ ] Pick limit
- [x] Pressing submit before choosing name breaks it - fix it
- [ ] If first pick occurs before all users in room, users not in room are locked out - fix it
- [ ] Timer

Ideas:

Solve first pick locked out problem - Create a waiting room and make sure the draft only starts once all users are in
